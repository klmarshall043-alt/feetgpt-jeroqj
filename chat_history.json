(e.g., \"The human foot has 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments.\")\n\n2. The Exposure & Normalization Gallery\nThis feature helps users challenge their aversion or shame through safe, controlled exposure.\n\n\"Feet in the Wild\" (Curated Gallery): A highly moderated, opt-in gallery of high-quality, non-sexualized photographs of diverse, real feet\u2014all shapes, sizes, and appearances\u2014submitted anonymously by other users or sourced ethically.\n\nGoal: Show the vast, natural diversity of human feet to normalize perceived flaws.\n\nPositive Language Prompts: When a user views the gallery, they are prompted to leave a supportive, non-critical comment focusing on function or care (e.g., \"These look strong,\" or \"I appreciate the care taken for these\").\n\nPerspective Shift Journal: Users can privately log their feelings before and after engaging with the gallery or performing a self-care routine, tracking their anxiety reduction over time.\n\n3. Social & Support (Optional Anonymity)\nThis feature provides a space for shared experience and reducing isolation.\n\nThe Shared Insecurity Post: Users can anonymously post a specific insecurity about their feet (e.g., \"I hate my bunions\" or \"I am terrified of people seeing my toes\").\n\n\"Common Ground\" Matcher: The app anonymously matches the user with three other users who have posted the exact same insecurity, allowing them to communicate in a private, time-limited group chat for shared support and advice."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.

Perhaps a new \"Learn\" tab for the Foot Health Tracker, a \"Gallery\" tab, and a \"Community\" tab for Social & Support.\n*   **UI Components:** Leverage reusable components like `ListItem`, `button`, and cards to maintain consistency.\n*   **Data Storage:** Since you want to implement features like user posts, gallery, and journal, you will need a backend.
