This is perfect for a standalone app without a backend. \n\n**Important:** Passwords are currently stored in plain text locally. For a production app with real user data, you would want to:\n- Enable Supabase authentication (press the Supabase button in Natively)\n- Use proper password hashing\n- Implement secure token-based authentication\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 User Flow:\n\n1. **New Users:**\n   - App opens \u2192 Sign-up screen\n   - Fill in username, email, and password\n   - Create account \u2192 Redirected to home screen\n\n2. **Returning Users:**\n   - App opens \u2192 Sign-in screen\n   - Enter email and password\n   - Sign in \u2192 Redirected to home screen\n\n3. **Signed-In Users:**\n   - App opens \u2192 Directly to home screen\n   - Can view profile with their information\n   - Can sign out from profile screen\n\nThe authentication system is now fully functional and ready to use!
